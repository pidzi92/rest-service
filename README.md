# rest-service
This is simple app that is processing CSV files and importing rows into in memory H@ database.

## Starting from IDE
### Prerequisites
1. IDE of your choice
2. Maven 3+
3. JDK 11

### How to start
1. Import project into your IDE
2. Create maven run configuration with goal clean install

3. Start your maven run configuration you have just created. Build should pass.
4. Find RestServiceApplication.java in your project tree. Right click. Run.

## DB
In memory H2 DB is used. schema.sql is read on startup and database is set up.

DB consists of two tables.

This can be optimized furthermore:

1. Create vehicle table with ID and Serial Number and create a relation to property_item via id.
Benefit: In case of changing SN, all telemetry data will get new values
2. Create telemetry_property_definition table that will have property_name and type. Then create a relation to telemetry_property and telemetry_property_definition
3. Using some king of DB versioning system, like [LiquiBase](https://www.liquibase.org/)

## CSV parsing

All CSV files starting with LD_A and LD_C are parsed, one by one.
Parsing can be optimized by implementing parsing in batches of rows and/or threads.

First the header is read. Each row in csv represents single telemetry item. Property values are dynamically assigned from column headers.

### Parsing headers

For each header there is a parsing process
1. Everything is removed in between [], including square brackets. This will remove unit from the header
2. All special characters are replaced with empty space
3. Convert Words To PascalCase
4. Remove all spaces

Example:
Ambient temperature [Â°C] -> AmbientTemperature

### Moving Processed Files
After the file is processed, it will be moved into PROCESSED subfolder

## DAO
This layer can be optimized by using Page and Pageable

[Pageable](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/domain/Pageable.html)

## Endpoints

Once the application is started, endpoints will be available on port 8080 by default. To change the port, please check application.properties

To check all available endpoints, use [swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#) once the application is started

## Other
1. There is just one application.properties file. Multiple files can be added for different environments so that spring-boot profiles can be utilized
